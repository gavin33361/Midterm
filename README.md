I made a page for the 2012 Avengers movie. It's sort of like a fan page. 
<br>
I have 4 web pages: home, screenshots, about, and actors.
<br>
<br>
Home page consists of gifs in a animation looped infinitely.
<br>
<br>
Screenshots page consists of an animation for the pictures and under it is a flexbox using animations to light up when corresponding pictures is shown.
<br>
<br>
About page consists of movie synopsis, with a transition over the image, and a reviews section. The reviews section consists of links to the various reviews.
<br>
<br>
The actors page consists of the major actors in the movie and their names can be clicked to go to their wikipedia page. If you click on the image of the actor, a lightbox will appear and show the image of their movie roles.
